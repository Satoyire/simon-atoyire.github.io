									<h2><a >About me<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>I am Simon Atoyire, a statistician, quantitative researcher, and educator with a strong foundation in Actuarial Science 
										and a Master’s degree in Statistics from Miami University (Ohio). My work bridges rigorous statistical research, applied analytics, 
										and consulting, with over five years of experience across academia, research-driven projects, and applied decision-support environments.
										 I specialize in transforming complex datasets into meaningful insight that informs policy, business strategy, and societal resilience.

										<br />My research focus centers on applied statistical modeling, time series analysis, and risk analytics, with particular emphasis on 
										climate-related and natural disaster impacts, forecasting extreme events, and quantifying economic loss under uncertainty. I have conducted 
										advanced research in hierarchical time series forecasting, simulation-based inference, and disaster loss modeling, and I actively engage in 
										interdisciplinary research that connects statistics with environmental science, economics, and public policy. My work emphasizes methodological rigor, 
										reproducibility, and real-world relevance.

										<br />Alongside my academic research, I provide analytics and statistical consulting to support organizations, researchers, and institutions in making 
										data-driven decisions. My consulting work spans predictive modeling, risk assessment, operational analytics, and research design, with clients in academic, 
										nonprofit, and applied research settings. I bring a strong applied perspective to consulting engagements, combining theoretical insight with practical 
										implementation using R, Python, SAS, and SQL, and prioritizing clarity, transparency, and impact in all analytical deliverables.
										
										<br />As an educator, I am deeply committed to student-centered and inclusive teaching, with experience supporting undergraduate and graduate instruction 
										in statistics, mathematics, and data analytics. I focus on helping learners build strong conceptual foundations while developing the computational and 
										communication skills needed to apply analytics responsibly in professional contexts. My actuarial background further strengthens my approach to teaching 
										and consulting in areas involving risk, uncertainty, and decision-making.
										
										<br />I am passionate about using statistics as a force for positive impact—to strengthen education, inform evidence-based policy, and support organizations 
										navigating complex, data-intensive challenges. My long-term goal is to contribute meaningfully to academic instruction, applied research, and institutional 
										capacity building, while also advancing interdisciplinary collaborations across business, environmental science, and public policy. Through teaching, research, 
										and professional service, I aim to train analytically grounded, ethically minded problem-solvers who can confidently navigate today’s data-driven world.
									    
										<br/> Beyond my professional work, I value a well-rounded and grounded life. I am an avid lover of football: both playing and watching. I enjoy the teamwork, 
										discipline, and strategy the game represents. I deeply cherish time spent with my family and friends, which keeps me balanced and motivated. I also have a strong 
										appreciation for art and music, finding creativity and inspiration in visual expression and sound. Above all, I am a dedicated Christian, and my faith shapes my values, 
										work ethic, and commitment to service, integrity, and compassion in both my personal and professional life.
